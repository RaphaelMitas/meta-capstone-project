# Submission for the Meta Frontend Developer Capstone Professional Certificate Project

This repository contains my submission for the Meta Frontend Developer Capstone Professional Certificate project. The project demonstrates my understanding and application of key frontend development concepts, including React and several libraries.

To start the site, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies with the command `npm install`.
2. Start the local development server with the command `npm start`.

After running the `npm start` command, the site should open in your default web browser. If it doesn't, you can manually navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port number indicated in your terminal) to view the site.
